## Karger's Minimum Cut

Karger's Minimum Cut is the algorithm calculating number of minimum cut after continuously randomly select nodes to merge.
Because it's a randomized algorithm, it does not guarantee to find optimal value. Therefore, you have to run several times
and choose the minimum value out of those results to get real minimum cut value
